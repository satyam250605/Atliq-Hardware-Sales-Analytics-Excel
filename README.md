This project is an advanced-level data analytics project focused on Sales Analytics for AtliQ Hardware, a company specializing in hardware and peripheral sales. The goal was to dive deep into sales data to generate key reports that would help the company improve its financial decision-making processes and monitor critical business KPIs.

Problem Overview :

AtliQ Hardware works with several large clients such as Croma, Best Buy, Staples, and Flipkart, and its sales data is scattered across multiple sources and is highly unorganized. In this project, I worked with over half a million sales records, leveraging ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) techniques to organize and structure the data. The reports produced provide actionable insights into the companyâ€™s sales performance and customer behavior.

Objectives:

The main objective of this project was to analyze the sales data for AtliQ Hardware and create several insightful reports that would help the company understand their performance and make data-driven decisions.

The specific goals were to:

1- Clean and organize the sales data using ETL processes. 2- Create performance reports for sales, customers, and markets. 3- Identify key performance trends in terms of sales growth, product performance, and profitability. 4- Help the company improve its net sales, gross margin, and overall financial health.

Data Preparation
The project involved cleaning and transforming the data using ETL processes:

Extract:- Extracted raw data from various sources like CSV and Excel files.

Transform:- Cleaned and transformed the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and aggregating it in a structured format.

Load:- Loaded the transformed data into Excel where further analysis could take place. I used Power Pivot to model the data and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for creating calculated columns and measures. These techniques allowed me to build interactive reports that can be used for decision-making.
